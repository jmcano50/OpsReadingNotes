## Readings: Installing Virtualbox with Linux Terminal

Below you will find some reading materials and videos that support today’s topic and the upcoming lecture.
Reading
Linux command line for beginner: Read parts 1-3. The rest is a how-to guide; skim as time allows.
1.	Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
•	Shell: Text-based interface for interacting with the operating system.
•	Terminal: Program providing a window for using the shell.
•	CLI: Text-based command interface for efficient and precise control.
•	Command Prompt: Windows-specific CLI.
•	These are used for efficiency, resource savings, automation, remote access, and precise control, even with graphical interfaces available.
2.	What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
•	Change Directories (cd):
o	 To move to a specific directory: cd directory_name
o	To go up one directory: cd ..
•	List File Contents (ls in Unix-like systems, dir in Windows):
o	To list files and directories: ls (Unix-like systems) or dir (Windows)
•	Rename/Move Files:
o	In Unix-like systems: mv old_name new_name (used for both renaming and moving)
o	In Windows: ren old_name new_name (for renaming) or move old_name new_directory (for moving)
3.	What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
•	Relative Path: Describes a location relative to the current directory.
•	Absolute Path: Specifies a location from the root directory.
•	Special characters:
o	~ (tilde): Represents the user's home directory.
o	/ (slash): Denotes the root directory in Unix-like systems.
4.	Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.•	Linux est un système d'exploitation open-source basé sur Unix. Il est utilisé dans le monde entier pour diverses applications, du mobile aux serveurs. Il est connu pour sa stabilité et sa personnalisation.
