# Vulnerability Name: SQL Injection

## Description:
SQL Injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to insert or "inject" a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. This flaw occurs due to insufficient input validation and allows attackers to manipulate the queries that an application makes to its database.

## Technical Description:
An application is vulnerable to SQL Injection if it uses unsanitized user input in SQL queries. Attackers can exploit this by supplying crafted input that has not been properly type-checked or escaped and can, therefore, alter the SQL commands that are executed by the database server. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, and execution of administrative operations on the database.

## Attack Scenarios:
- Scenario 1: A web application uses unparameterized queries to authenticate users. An attacker could supply a username as `admin' -- `and any password. The resulting query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = '...'` effectively comments out the password check, leading to unauthorized administrative access.
- Scenario 2: A user input for a search function is directly included in a SQL query. By entering a payload like `'; DROP TABLE users; --',an attacker could potentially delete critical tables from the database.

## Security Weakness:
SQL Injection often occurs due to:
- Lack of input validation.
- Direct concatenation of user input in SQL queries.
- Use of dynamic SQL instead of prepared statements or stored procedures.

## Impact:
The impact of SQL Injection can be quite severe, ranging from unauthorized viewing of data to complete host takeover. Consequences include:
- Data theft: Attackers can read sensitive data from the database.
- Data loss or corruption: Malicious SQL can alter or delete data.
- Authentication bypass: Attackers may log in as other users, including administrators.
- Remote code execution: In some databases, SQL Injection can be used to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Mitigation
To protect against SQL Injection, developers should:
- Use prepared statements with parameterized queries.
- Employ stored procedures.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization.
- Apply the principle of least privilege by restricting database permissions.
- Keep database software and applications up-to-date with security patches.
