[What is a Sniffing Attack in System Hacking?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-sniffing-attack-in-system-hacking/)

1. Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms.
    - It's like eavesdropping on a digital conversation to steal sensitive information.
2. What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach?
    - Passive: Quietly listening to network traffic without altering it.
    - Active: Actively interacting with the network to gather more information, including encrypted data.
3. How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks?
    - It encodes data so only authorized parties can understand it, keeping it safe from interception during sniffing attacks.
