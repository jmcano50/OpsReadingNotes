**What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?**

The Windows Registry is like the brain of your computer. It stores all the special settings for Windows and the apps you use.

**What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?**

There are two kinds of settings in the Registry: one for each person who uses the computer (like having their own preferences), and one that's the same for everyone (like the default settings).

**What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?**

"Registry hacks" are like secret tricks to change things in your computer that you cannot usually change. People use them to make their computers look or work how they want.

**What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?**

You can use the Registry to do stuff like changing how your computer looks or making it work better.

**Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?**

**Imagine the Windows Registry is like a big, fancy restaurant menu. In this comparison:**

The menu holds all the important recipes for the dishes the chef (your computer) can make.
Each dish (setting) has its own recipe (registry entry) with specific instructions on how to make it taste just right.
Sometimes, you might want to add or change a secret ingredient (registry hack) to make the dish exactly the way you love it. Just like at a restaurant, you can ask the chef (computer) to make changes to your order (settings) to suit your taste.
