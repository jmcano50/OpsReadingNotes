## What’s the Difference Between Windows and Windows Server?

**What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer?** 

- Windows Server runs services people access across a network and does not have a destop option, Windows has a GUI (Grafical User Interface) and Windows Server does not (recommended my Microsoft to not have a GUI). Windows server supports higher end hardware. Windows Server is also more expensive ranging from $500 and $6200.

**How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesn’t know much about computers?**

-Windows is like a single driver for people like uber or lyft but Windows server is a fleet of car providing a service or multiple drivers. Both are similar but Windows focus is on the Micro vision and the Windows server focus is on the Macro vision.

**How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?**

- Windows home and Pro receives updates from Microsoft account and Windows Server does not cupport signing in with a Microsoft account and can disable updates entirely through group policy.

**Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?**

- Windows Pro has a max limit of 2TB of RAM, Windows Home supports only one pysical CPU, Windows Pro supports max or 2 CPU and Windows Server allows for 24 TB of RAM, no limit on cores
