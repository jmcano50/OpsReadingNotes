[IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a Virtual Private Cloud?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vpc)

**What are some of the key features of the VPC model?**
- Isolation: VPC provides network isolation within a cloud environment.
- Customization: Customize your VPC by defining its IP address range, creating subnets, configuring route tables, and setting up security groups and network ACLs (Access Control Lists).
- Private Networking: VPCs allow you to create private networks within the cloud, which means you can launch instances with private IP addresses that are not directly accessible from the internet.
- Security: VPCs offer robust security controls. You can define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic and use Network ACLs to set rules at the subnet level.
- Connectivity Options: VPCs can be connected to other VPCs or to on-premises data centers using VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) or Direct Connect.

**What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?**
- Presentation Tier (User Interface Tier)
- Application Tier (Logic Tier)
- Data Tier (Database Tier)

**Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.**
- As a Chicago Police Officer
    - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like creating secure zones within a cloud environment, similar to how different areas of a city are separated for specific purposes.

    - VPN (Virtual Private Network) is like a secure radio channel or phone line that allows secure communication between police officers in different locations, ensuring their converstaions are private even on a public network.
