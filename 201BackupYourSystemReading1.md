## How to Use System Restore

**What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool?**
The Windows System Restore tool is used to recover users computer system to a previous working state. It allows you to undo system changes, such as driver installations or software installations, that may have caused problems. System Restore creates restore points at specific intervals, and you can choose to restore your system to a point where it was functioning correctly.

**How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?**
The time it takes to use the System Restore tool can vary depending on several factors, including the system's performance, the amount of data to be restored, and the chosen restore point. Typically, it may take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour or more.

**How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt?**
To start System Restore from the command prompt, you can follow these steps:

-Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges (you can search for "cmd" in the Start menu, right-click, and choose "Run as administrator").

-Type the following command and press Enter: rstrui.exe.

-This command opens the System Restore utility, allowing you to select a restore point and initiate the restoration process.

**What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem?**
If System Restore did not resolve the issue, you have a few options:

-Try restoring to a different restore point: Sometimes, a different restore point may work better.

-Manually uninstall recently installed software or drivers: If you suspect a particular software or driver caused the issue, uninstalling it manually may help.

-Seek additional troubleshooting: You may need to diagnose the problem further or seek help from technical support or online forums to find a solution.
