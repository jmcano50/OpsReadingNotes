## Reading 3 HowToGeek What is BIOS, Learn Computer Science - What is BIOS: Only read down to the end of the CMOS section.

1.	What is the BIOS?
•	Basic Input Output System utility program loads the operating system when the computer is turned on.
2.	Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
•	Boot Process as a Human Wake-Up Routine: Think of the boot process as waking up in the morning. When you open your eyes (power on the computer), your body (hardware) goes through a series of checks to ensure everything functions correctly. You might stretch (hardware initialization) and take a moment to assess how you feel (hardware self-checks). Once you are confident that you are in good shape, start your daily routine (launch the operating system).
3.	What is the "Power On Self-Test"?
•	The Power On Self-Test is a diagnostic process that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) performs when the computer is powered on or restarted. The primary purpose of Power On Self-Test is to ensure that the computer's hardware components, such as the CPU, memory (RAM), storage devices, and other essential peripherals, are functioning correctly and are in a state ready for the operating system to take control.
4.	What is the CMOS?
•	Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor refers to both a semiconductor technology used in computer chips and a specific component in computers. In computer hardware, CMOS typically refers to the CMOS memory and CMOS battery. The CMOS memory stores crucial system settings like date, time, and BIOS configuration. 
5.	What is the CMOS battery?
•	The CMOS battery provides power to maintain these settings when the computer is turned off. When the CMOS battery fails, it can lead to issues with incorrect system settings, highlighting its importance in maintaining system integrity.

Notes: 
Future Learn
  CPU - Brains of Computer
  RAM - Temp stores data
  ROM - Read-only memory stores the BIOS
  Hard Drive - main storage
  BIOS -  contains all the basic code for controlling your computer hardware 
  Operating System - the operating system is normally stored on the hard drive, but you 
  can load an operating system from a USB drive or a CD instead
