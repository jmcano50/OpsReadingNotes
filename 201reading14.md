# How to remove malware from your Windows PC

**1.	What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?**

- Anti-virus software is designed to detect and remove viruses specifically, while anti-malware software detects and removes a broader range of threats, including viruses, spyware, adware, tojans, worms, and other types of malicious software.

**2.	What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?**

- Unexpected pop-up, browser redirects, messages appearing on your screen.

- High CPU, memory, or network usage

- Browser homepage and search engine changes you did not make

- Slow computer performance

- Unfamiliar programs running in th ebackground

- Files disappearing or becoming corrupted

**3.	Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.**

- A full system scan checks every file on your computer, which is more thorough but slower. A quick scan only checks key areas like system files and memory for active infections, which is faster but may miss dormant or hidden malware.

**4.	What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?**

- If infected with ransomeware, first disconnect your computer from all networks to prevent the infection from spreading. Then use a clean, uninfected system to research the specific ransomware type and check if decryption tools are available. Restoring from backups is the most reliable way to recover your files if decrytion is not an option.

**5.	Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?**

- On Windows, atimalware apps provide active scanning and real-time protection. MacOS relies more on preventing malware with Gatekeeper and XProtect built into the OS. Linux users must manually scan for and remove malware, but the OS's permissions system helps limit infections. The difference reflect cultural priorities is Windows enphasizes reactive security while MacOS and Linux take a more proactive approach based on sytem design.
