[Tracking, Detecting, and Thwarting PowerShell-based Malware and Attacks](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/tracking-detecting-and-thwarting-powershell-based-malware-and-attacks)


1. **You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst, how would you explain your role to a family member?**
- Think of someone trying to break into your car. I am the undercover officer that watches for these intruders, understands how they might try to get in, and works to strengthen the car locks and alarms to keep the car safe. But instead of a car, I'm protecting the computer systems and networks from cybercriminals.
2. **Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector.**
- PowerShell is included with Windows that can automate a wide range of system tasks. It can execute scripts, manage system settings, and access networks and the internet. This flexibility makes it a favored tool for attackers to exploit, allowing them to hide their activities, manage malware, and steal data more easily, often without triggering traditional antivirus detections.
3. **What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?**
- **Execution Policy Restrictions:** Set policies to restrict the execution of PowerShell scripts to those that are signed and trusted. This helps prevent malicious scripts from running.
- **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring:** Implement advanced logging features in PowerShell to capture detailed information about script executions. Monitor these logs for suspicious activities. This can help in identifying and responding to attacks quickly.
