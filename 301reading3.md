## Reading 3
**CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes
What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?**

- CIDR notation is a way to represent IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. 
- A CIDR block is a range of IP addresses specified in CIDR notation.

**How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?**

- An IPv4 address consists of 4 octets.

**Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?**
- In decimal, an octet ranges from 0 to 255.

**What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?**

- The final digit after the “/” in an IPv4 address represents the prefix length or subnet mask.

**How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?**

- There are 256 IP addresses in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24

**What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters?**

**In your own words, describe network segmentation.**
- Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a computer network into segments to improve performance, security, and manageability.

**Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network uses a well-configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?**

- Disagree. Network segmentation enhances security by isolating and controlling access within segments, complementing firewall configurations.

**What is a screened subnet?**

- A screened subnet is a network architecture that uses screening routers and firewalls to create a secure zone between an internal network and external networks.

**Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors, and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?**

- These examples represent physical security measures.
