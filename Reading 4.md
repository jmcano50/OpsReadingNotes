How do I install software from the command line?
•	To install software from the command line, use package management tools like apt on Debian/Ubuntu. First, update the package repository information with apt update or yum/dnf update, and then install the desired software with apt install or yum/dnf install, replacing "package-name" with the software you want. Always use sudo for superuser privileges when running these commands.
