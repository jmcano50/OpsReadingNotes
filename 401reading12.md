[What is a SOC?](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-a-security-operations-center.html)

**What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?**
- Monitoring network Security
- Responding to Security Incidents
- Managing Security Tools and Technologies

**Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.**
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is like a security control center. It collects and analyzes data from various sources in an organization to detect potential security threats. SOCs use it to spot unusual activities and respond to them quickly.

**How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.**
- Both the SOC and Help Desk have different levels of expertise. in a SOC, there are front-line analysts who handle initial security alerts (like help desk staff addressing basic IT issues), and more experienced analysts or mangers who handle complex security incidents, much like how complicated issues are escalated to senior IT staff.
