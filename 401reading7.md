# Readings: Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

## Reading 7
[Data Protection: Data In transit vs. Data At Rest](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/data-protection-data-in-transit-vs-data-at-rest)

1. **From your day-to-day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.**
    - Stored Files: Documents, photos, and videos on your computer hard drive.
    - Emails: Emails and documents saved in your inbox on an email server.
    - Cloud Storage Data: Files and documents saved in the cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud).
    - Database Records: Data stored in databases used by various applications, whether on your local machine or on a server.
    - Backup Data: Data that is backed up and stored on external hard drives, USB drives, or cloud backup services.

2. **Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.**
- Confidentiality: 
    - Encryption is key in preserving confidentiality, as it scrambles data, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.
- Integrity: 
    - Encryption maintains integrity by preventing unauthorized changes to data, both at rest and in transit.
- Availability: Encryption by itself does not directly contribute to availability; the security it provides ensures that data is protected from negligence, unauthorized deletions or alterations, therefore maintaining its availability.
