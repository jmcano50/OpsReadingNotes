### Encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric

Encryption is a fundamental aspect of data protection, ensuring confidentiality and integrity by transforming readable data into an unreadable format. It comes in two main types: symmetric and asymmetric encryption, each serving different purposes and scenarios in cybersecurity.

#### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption, also known as private-key encryption, uses a single key for both encryption and decryption of data. This method is efficient and fast, making it suitable for encrypting large volumes of data or for systems with limited computational resources.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Speed:** Generally faster than asymmetric encryption due to simpler algorithms.
  - **Key Management:** The biggest challenge is secure key distribution and management, as the same key must be securely shared among parties.
  - **Use Cases:** Widely used for data at rest (e.g., encrypting files on a disk) and data in transit (e.g., securing data sent over a network).

- **Common Algorithms:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), and RC4.

#### Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption, or public-key encryption, uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This key pair is mathematically related, yet it is computationally infeasible to deduce the private key from the public key. 

- **Key Features:**
  - **Key Distribution:** Eases the problem of key exchange. Anyone can encrypt data using the public key, but only the holder of the paired private key can decrypt it.
  - **Digital Signatures:** Enables not only encryption but also authentication and non-repudiation through digital signatures.
  - **Use Cases:** Commonly used for secure communication over insecure channels (e.g., the Internet), including email encryption and securing connections between web browsers and servers (SSL/TLS).

- **Common Algorithms:** RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and DH (Diffie-Hellman).

#### Comparison and Integration

- **Strengths and Weaknesses:** Symmetric encryption is faster but faces challenges in secure key distribution. Asymmetric encryption, while slower due to its complex algorithms, solves the key distribution problem and provides mechanisms for digital signatures and certificates.
- **Integrated Use in SSL/TLS:** SSL/TLS protocols, used for securing internet communications, exemplify how symmetric and asymmetric encryption can be combined. Asymmetric encryption secures the initial key exchange, establishing a secure channel. Then, symmetric encryption takes over for the session, encrypting the bulk of the data due to its efficiency.

#### Conclusion

Understanding both symmetric and asymmetric encryption is crucial for implementing comprehensive security strategies. By leveraging the strengths of each and understanding their applications, organizations can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.

  - **Common HTTP Request Methods:** Details the types of requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
  - **HTTP Status Codes:** Provides feedback on the outcome of the HTTP request.

#### HTTP Request-Response Cycle

Understanding the HTTP request-response cycle is crucial for web application security, detailing how clients and servers exchange data.

1. **Client Sends Request:** Initiates the cycle with a request to the server.
2. **Server Processes Request:** The server processes the incoming request.
3. **Server Sends Response:** The server responds back to the client.
4. **Client Receives Response:** The client receives and, typically, displays the response.

#### Common HTTP Request Methods

| Method | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | Requests data from a specified resource.         |
| POST   | Submits data to be processed to a resource.      |
| PUT    | Updates a specified resource with new data.      |
| DELETE | Deletes the specified resource.                  |

#### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description                                      |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 200  | OK - The request was successful.                 |
| 404  | Not Found - The resource was not found.          |
| 500  | Internal Server Error - A server error occurred. |
| 403  | Forbidden - Request is understood but refused.   |

#### TCP Handshake (SYN/ACK)

The TCP handshake, also known as the three-way handshake, is a three-step process used to establish a connection between a client and server in a TCP/IP network. It involves the following steps:

| Step      | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. SYN    | The client sends a SYN packet to the server to initiate a connection request.                           |
| 2. SYN-ACK| If the server is available and willing to establish a connection, it responds with a SYN-ACK packet, indicating acknowledgment of the client's request and its readiness to proceed. |
| 3. ACK    | Finally, the client sends an ACK packet back to the server, acknowledging the server's response. This completes the handshake process, and both sides are now synchronized and can start exchanging data. |

The TCP handshake is a fundamental aspect of network communication, ensuring reliable and orderly transmission of data between clients and servers.
