1. **You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.**
- As a Malware Analyst, I identify, analyze, and neutralize malware. I study malicious software to understand how it works, its impact, and how to protect against it. This involves investigating suspicious files, analyzing malware behavior in a secure environment, creating defenses, documenting findings, and staying updated on cybersecurity trends.
2. **What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?**
- Preparation
- Collection
- Analysis
- Documentation
- Mitigation
- Reporting
    -   A mnemonic: PCADMR - Please Call A Doctor, Malware's Rising.
3. **You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?**
- I would start with Static Analysis because it allows me to examine the malware's code and properties without executing it, reducing risk and quickly providing initial insights into its capabilities and potential impact.
