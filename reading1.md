### Reading #1 Case Study: China’s Spy Chip

###How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
Hardware Hack vs. Software Hack:
•	Hardware hack involves physically tampering with computer parts, while a software hack involves exploiting software weaknesses.
•	Hardware hacks need physical access, while software hacks can be done remotely.

###What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
Two Ways for Spies to Alter Hardware:
1.	Inserting Malicious Chips: Spies may secretly put harmful chips into computers.
2.	Supply Chain Attack: Spies manipulate the production process to get compromised components into devices.

###Explain how the hack worked.
1.	Supply Chain Manipulation: The adversary infiltrates a manufacturer's facility that produces the specific computer's microchips. They introduce a malicious chip into the production process without the manufacturer's knowledge.
2.	Distribution: The compromised chips are distributed to various computer manufacturers, who use them in their products. The targeted government agency purchases computers containing these compromised chips.
3.	Exploitation: The malicious chip may have a backdoor or vulnerability that the adversary can exploit remotely. They gain access to the compromised computers within the government agency's network.
4.	Data Exfiltration: The adversary collects sensitive data from the compromised computers, conducts espionage, or carries out other malicious activities.


###How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
Tracing Back to the Source:
1.	Detect Suspicious Activity: Investigators spot unusual computer behavior.
2.	Investigation: They analyze the computer and find the sneaky chip.
3.	Trace Supply Chain: They follow the chip's path back to where it was made.
4.	Attribution: Authorities figure out who did it through investigation and intelligence work.
