[What is penetration testing](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/penetration-testing/)

1. How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?
    - Both pen testing and the Cyber Kill Chain focus on how attackers could infiltrate a system. They start by gathering information about the target (like finding weak spots or learning about the network). Then, they craft and deliver attacks, exploit vulnerabilities, gain control, move around to other parts of the system, and finally, steal or disrupt things.

2. Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?
    - Finding Weaknesses: Pen testing helps find and fix problems in the company's systems before bad actors exploit them.
    - Reducing Risks: It helps figure out the most critical risks so the company can focus on fixing them.
    - Meeting Rules: Many industries have rules saying you need to check security regularly. Pen testing helps follow these rules.
    - Getting Ready for Attacks: It helps improve how the company can handle cyberattacks by finding gaps in their defense.
    - Building Trust: Doing regular pen testing shows customers and partners that the company cares about security.
    - Saving Money: Fixing problems found in pen tests is cheaper than dealing with a real attack.
    - Keep Getting Better: Pen testing isn't a one-time thing; it's ongoing. It helps the company keep getting better at protecting itself from cyber threats.
