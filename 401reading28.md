# Readings: Log Clearing


## Reading
[Log Tampering 101](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/ethical-hacking-log-tampering-101/)

1. **Explain some specifics of why a hacker might want to clear log files to a family member. Do not use the example from the article.**
- Think of a burglar breaking into a house to steal valuable items. Now, this burglar knows that security cameras are installed throughout the house, recording every movement. If the burglar leaves those recordings untouched, they risk being identified and caught by the police. So, what do they do? They find a way to disable or erase those recordings, ensuring there's no evidence left behind of their illegal entry and activities.
- In hacking, computer systems keep logs just like security cameras record footage. These logs document every action taken on the system. If a hacker gains unauthorized access to a computer system and performs malicious activities, leaving those logs intact could lead to their identification and capture by cybersecurity professionals. Therefore, by clearing log files, hackers erase the digital evidence of their intrusion, making it harder for authorities to track them down.
2. **What are three methods by which you can clear logs in a Windows system?**
- **Manual Deletion:** The hacker can manually delete log files stored in specific directories or using commands in the command prompt.
- **Automated Scripts:** They can write or use pre-existing scripts that automatically delete log files at regular intervals or upon triggering certain events.
- **Tampering with Logging Services:** By compromising the logging services or software running on the Windows system, hackers can manipulate them to either stop logging or delete existing logs.
3. **What are the four steps in the process of covering your tracks?**
- **Clearing Logs:** Deleting or modifying log files to remove evidence of unauthorized access or malicious activities.
- **Deleting Forensic Traces:** This includes erasing any other digital traces, such as temporary files, cookies, or cached data that could reveal the hacker's presence or actions.
- **Hiding Malware:** If the hacker deployed malware during the intrusion, they might take steps to conceal its presence to evade detection b antivirus programs or system administrators.
- **Masking IP Addresses:** To further obfuscate their identity, hackers may use techniques such as proxy servers or virtual private networks (VPNs) to disguise their IP address when carrying out attacks.
